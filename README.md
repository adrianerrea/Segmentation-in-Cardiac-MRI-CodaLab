# Segmentation-in-Cardiac-MRI-CodaLab

## Description

In recent years, many machine/deep learning models have been proposed to accurately quantify and diagnose cardiac pathologies. However, the segmentation of the right ventricle (RV) is a challenging task due to the highly complex and variable shape of the RV and its ill-defined borders in cardiac MR images. The last MICCAI challenge to focus on right ventricular segmentation took place in 2012, well before the deep learning revolution, and was based on 48 cases from a single clinical center. As part of the 12th Workshop on Statistical Atlases and Computational Modelling of the Heart (STACOM 2021), we invite participants to implement and evaluate advanced machine/deep learning approaches for right ventricular segmentation, based on a large multi-disease, multi-view and multi-center sample of 360 cardiac MRI datasets. A novel aspect of this challenge is the inclusion of long-axis images to help the automatic definition of the basal plane of the RV, which can be confused with the right atrium.
